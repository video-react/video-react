Video.React is a web video player built from the ground up for an HTML5 world using React library.

### âœ¨ The future of Video.React

Maintenance of Video.React is being taken over by [Mux](https://www.mux.com). The team at Mux have worked on many highly respected projects and are committed to improving video tooling for developers.

Video.React will remain open source, but with a higher rate of fixes and releases over time. Thanks to everyone in the community for your ongoing support.

## Installation

```sh
npm install --save video-react react react-dom
